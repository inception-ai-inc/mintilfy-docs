All API requests require authentication using API keys. Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure.

#### **Obtaining API Keys**

You can generate API keys from your [Inception Platform Dashboard](https://platform.inceptionlabs.ai/dashboard/api-keys).

#### **Using API Keys**

Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer INCEPTION_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
  **Security Note:** Never expose your API keys in client-side code or commit them to version control. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system.
