title: "Realtime"
---

Inception API supports a Realtime mode that enables near-instant responses from Mercury.

This is ideal for:

- Voice assistants
- Customer support chatbots
- Real-time decision systems
- Low-latency workflows and automations

```bash
curl https://api.inceptionlabs.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer INCEPTION_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "mercury",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant." },
      { "role": "user", "content": "What is a diffusion model?" }
    ],
    "realtime": true
  }'
```
